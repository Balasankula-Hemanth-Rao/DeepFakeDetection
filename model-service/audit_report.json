    "Identity overlap detected: Remove or reallocate samples to ensure no person appears in multiple splits. Affected identities: person_001 (train→val), person_042 (train→val), person_089 (train→val). This is critical for model generalization.",
    "Identical audio tracks found across splits: Extract audio separately or verify split assignment for these samples. 2 audio collisions detected between val and test splits. Check if these are annotation errors or preprocessing artifacts.",
    "Suspicious metadata clusters detected: Verify samples were independently collected and not batch-processed identically. Large clusters of identically-configured videos (1204 @1920x1080, 687 @1280x720) suggest potential batch processing or same-source data."
